Module 15 Challenge

See the files in the static folder of Leaflet-Part-1 for the coding for this project.

Nothing was required as part of the rubric for Leaflet-Part-2 and no additional readme was required or is part of the rubric for the challenge. I may come back later to complete Leaflet-Part-2 and update this readme for my portfolio.
